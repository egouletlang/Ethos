/**
 The CacheEntry class serves as a building block for the various cache classes available in EthosUtil & Beyond. It
 conveniently stores both a `value` (the thing you want to store) and an associated `cost` to the system. The `cost`
 component is optional and **defaults to zero**; the idea was to provide a compute efficient way of determining how
 "big" the cached resources.
 
 `K` can be any type you want but picking a type conforms to NSCoding is useful because most caches support some sort
 of offline mode which allows you to persist your cached data across app sessions.
 
 - TODO: Make CacheEntry only conform to NSCoding when K does as well.
